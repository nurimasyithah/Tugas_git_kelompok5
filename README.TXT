PROJECT TITLE: Employee Management System

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This project demonstrates the implementation of key object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction/interfaces. It models a simple Employee Management System with different types of employees, including Students, Teachers, Managers, Engineers, and general Employees.

VERSION or DATE: November 2023

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
To start this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Run the `Main` class to execute the sample scenarios.

AUTHORS:
- [Your Name]

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the classes representing different types of employees (Student, Teacher, Manager, Engineer, Employee) and the relationships between them.
2. Explore the use of encapsulation to hide the internal details of the Person class.
3. Understand how inheritance is utilized to create specialized classes (e.g., Student, Teacher) based on a common base class (Person).
4. Explore the polymorphic behavior demonstrated in the Office class, where information is printed based on the type of Person object.
5. Examine the abstraction/interfaces (Eatable, Sleepable, Workable) implemented in the Worker class, showcasing multiple interface implementation.
6. Run the provided Main class to see examples of creating different employee objects and printing their information.

Feel free to modify and extend the project to suit your needs or integrate it into a larger system.
